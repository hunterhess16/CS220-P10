    "\n",
    "Cleaning data is an important part of a data scientist's work cycle. As you have already seen, the data we will be analyzing in P10 and P11 has been split up into 15 different files of different formats. Even worse, as you shall see later in this project, some of these files have been corrupted, and lots of data is missing. Unfortunately, in the real world, a lot of data that you will come across will be in rough shape, and it is your job to clean it up before you can analyze it. In P10, you will combine the data in these different files to create a few manageable data structures, which can be easily analyzed. In the process, you will also have to deal with broken CSV files (by skipping rows with broken data), and broken JSON files (by skipping the files entirely).\n",

We'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope during code review.\n",

If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",

    "Required Data Structures:\n",

    "- `Planet` (**namedtuple**)\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:\n",

    "* You are **not** allowed to use *bare* `try/except` blocks. In other words, you can **not** use `try/except` without explicitly specifying the type of exceptions that you want to catch.\n",
    "* You are **only** allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of P10. In particular, this means that you are **not** allowed to use **modules** like `pandas` to answer the questions in this project.\n",
    "* Please do not dsplay `start_dict` or `planets_dict` anywhere in the notebook unless explicitly mentioned. Please remove such print statements before submission.\n",

    "**Important Warning:** You are **not** allowed to **hardcode** the indices of the broken rows. You may inspect `planets_4.csv` to identify how to tell a **broken row** apart. Therefore, to use the example of the **broken row** above, you **may not** hardcode to skip the **566**th row of `planets_4.csv`. However, it is **acceptable** to make your function **skip** any row for which the value under the `Discovery Year` is not numeric, by observing that this is the reason why the row is broken."
